## **Introduction (15-20 sec)**
**Yuan Chen**:  
Hi, I’m **Yuan Chen**, founder of **TaxFront**. I have a background in **backend engineering, financial systems, and AI-driven automation**.  

Previously, I worked at **Amazon Web Services** as a Software Engineer Intern, where I developed automation tools for **code validation and security** using Python. I also optimized developer workflows by integrating security compliance into **CI/CD pipelines**.  

After that, I joined **Barclays Investment Bank** as a **Backend Software Engineer**, where I built **large-scale financial data pipelines** for **trading, risk management, and compliance**. My work involved **processing high-volume financial transactions**, optimizing data models, and cutting **infrastructure costs** through strategic **data warehouse planning**.  

Now, I’m leveraging my expertise in **finance, automation, and AI** to revolutionize **tax management** with **TaxFront**.

## **What We’re Building (20-25 sec)**
At **TaxFront**, we are building an **AI-powered tax platform** to **automate and simplify tax document management**.  

Here’s what it does:  
- Users can **securely upload and organize** tax documents with **client-side encryption**.  
- Our **AI automatically categorizes** documents and detects **missing or incorrect forms**.  
- It tracks **document status in real-time**, ensuring users are **always tax-ready**.  
- Businesses and accountants get a **streamlined dashboard** with **year-over-year comparisons** and **automated insights**.  

This is more than just document storage—it’s a **smart tax companion** that **reduces errors, saves time, and ensures compliance**.

## **Why This Matters (10-15 sec)**
Tax preparation is **frustrating, time-consuming, and prone to mistakes**.  

Current solutions are either:  
1. **Too complex** (built for accountants, not everyday users).  
2. **Too manual** (requiring extensive user input and organization).  

TaxFront **solves this problem** with **intelligent automation**, giving individuals and businesses a **hassle-free** way to manage taxes.
